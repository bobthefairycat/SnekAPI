# SnekAPI

Starter code I wrote for the ESC190 project when I was course coordinator (Jan - April 2020 offering). 

The project description can be found in Project_Topics.pdf and the API documentation in Snek.pdf -- the original API was written in C and included support for compiling a Python library.
